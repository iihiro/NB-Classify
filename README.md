# NB-Classify
NB-Classify library enables outsourcing of data classification tasks to a cloud server without decryption of data by using FHE to allow secure computation.
The library also provides a program for training your classification model and writing it out to the required format for the program.

# Prerequisites
* Ubuntu LTS 16.04
* glibc 2.23
* g++ 5.4.0
* cmake 3.5
* [HElib](https://github.com/homenc/HElib)

# How to build
1. Build and install [HElib](https://github.com/homenc/HElib) according to Option 1 in INSTALL.md with the `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` option added to Step 2.
2. Run the following commands at the root of NB-Classify library to build the library.
    ```terminal
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake -Dhelib_DIR=$(HELIB_DIRECTORY)/helib_pack/share/cmake/helib ..
    $ make
    ```
    where `$(HELIB_DIRECTORY)` is the directory where HElib is installed.
3. Once the library is built, return to the root of library

# Format of data sets and other files
## List of necessary files
* `$(dataset_name)_info.csv`
* `$(dataset_name)_model.csv`
* `$(dataset_name)_test.csv`
* `$(dataset_name)_train.csv`  (unnecessary if you are going to use your own program for training, given that the model will be formatted in the correct way)

where `$(dataset_name)` is the name of the data set you will later use when running the programming.

A set of sample files is provided in the `datasets` directory. 

You can use `train.py` to train a classification model and write it out to the required format given that the `$(dataset_name)_info.csv` and `$(dataset_name)_train.csv` is formatted correctly.

## Format of $(dataset_name)_info.csv
First row contains names of the class labels. From second row, it contains the names or a value of a feature value for each attribute, one attirubte per row.

Example is given below where N is the number of classes, m is the number of feature values for attribute j.
```
label_0, label_1, ... , label_N
f_0_0, f_1_0, ... , f_m_0
f_0_1, f_1_1, ... , f_m_1
...
f_0_j, f_1_j, ... , f_m_j
```

## Format of $(dataset_name)_model.csv
First row contains the class probabilities. Then, seperated by empty line, it contains series of conditional probabilities where each line contains a conditional probability for each feature value and attribute.
Example is given below where N is the number of classes, m is the number of feature values for attribute j.
```
cl_0, cl_1, ... , cl_N

cp_0_0_0, cp_0_1_0, ... , cp_0_m_0
cp_0_0_1, cp_0_1_1, ... , cp_0_m_1
...
cp_0_0_j, cp_0_1_j, ... , cp_0_m_j

cp_1_0_0, cp_1_1_0, ... , cp_1_m_0
cp_1_0_1, cp_1_1_1, ... , cp_1_m_1
...
cp_1_0_j, cp_1_1_j, ... , cp_1_m_j


...


cp_N_0_0, cp_N_1_0, ... , cp_N_m_0
cp_N_0_1, cp_N_1_1, ... , cp_N_m_1
...
cp_N_0_j, cp_N_1_j, ... , cp_N_m_j
```

## Format of $(dataset_name)_test.csv and $(dataset_name)_train.csv
Each line contains data for classification where each value is the feature value for an attribute and the last value is the actual label. 
```
f0, f1, ..., fj, label
```
